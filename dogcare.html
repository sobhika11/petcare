        <dl>

            <dd>
                Feed your dog high-quality food tailored to their age, size, breed, and activity level. Puppies, adults, and seniors all have different dietary needs.

            <br>
            <dd>
                Avoid feeding your dog harmful human foods like chocolate, grapes, onions, and anything with caffeine or alcohol.

        <h2>Exercise</h2>
        <dl>
            <dd>
                Dogs need physical activity to stay fit and release energy. The amount depends on breed and ageâ€”active breeds might need over an hour daily, while others need less.
             </dd>
             <br>
             <dd>Playtime and engaging toys (puzzles, chew toys, fetch) help prevent boredom and behavioral issues.</dd>
